# TinySwords

A simple pixel art strategy game prototype made with Unity.

This is my first Unity learning project, completed in a week with almost no prior experience with Unity. I used C# before, but that was a while ago, in a WPF project. I love funny pixel art assets and HoMM2, hence the setting and the gameplay. It's also an attempt to complete a certain GD school project on my own - to create a simple HoMM-like strategy game with at least 3 different units moving on a square or hexagonal tile map.
